#
#       This will return the average cost of housing that year in INT form
#       We will use this to compare our findings from kaggle price register data


#       We will find an algorithm to calculate average price increase from 2010 - 2016 using excel sheet
#       Then use that algorithm to predict 2017 - 2020 increase and perhaps even further
#       We could collect our own data from property listings to use as more recent data

# we slice 1 through 47 as first item is place name and there is 47 years included in data (48 is not included in slicing logic)
